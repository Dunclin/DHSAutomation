# DHS Automation — Header Logo Fix Package

What's included
---------------
- `index.html` — header shows only the logo (no trailing text).
- `site-assets/dhs-logo.png` — the DHS ladder-logic logo used in the header.

How to deploy
-------------
1. Upload `index.html` to the **root** of your GitHub Pages repo.
2. Upload `site-assets/dhs-logo.png` to the **site-assets** folder.
3. Commit to `main` and refresh your site.

Notes
-----
- If you have a different final logo file, just overwrite `site-assets/dhs-logo.png` with your preferred image.
- The header `<img>` already references `site-assets/dhs-logo.png`.
